  I have never considered Python to be heavily influenced by functional
  languages, no matter what people say or think. I was much more familiar
  with imperative languages such as C and Algol 68 and although I had made
  functions first-class objects, I didn't view Python as a functional
  programming language.  -- Guido van Rossum



*怎么说呢，感觉翻译的挺烂的，不打算做任何宣传，能不能发现这个 project 随缘吧
毕竟不是人每个都需要函数式编程*
